                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a young software engineer from New Jersey, proficent 
                        in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My love for coding started 
                        at a young age, when my middleschool friend told me about a 
                        website called "Codecademy". That website helped me discover why 
                        I'm passionate about so much. I realized that I could put anything 
                        I wanted on the screen, and that unlocked the creativity in my brain. 
                        Since then I've taken (and still am taking) multiple Udemy courses on 
                        different languages, as well as a web development bootcamp created by Rutgers University.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Apart from coding, I also love hockey, coffee, and music (writing, playing, listening, anything you could imagine!).
